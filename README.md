# parkfinder

Parkfinder is a browser-based user interface for searching the U.S. national parks by name, location, and activities offered.   

## About
This project consists of two parts. This is the repository for the frontend. You can also find the repository for the backend here: [https://github.com/ceptember/phase-3-sinatra-react-project](https://github.com/ceptember/phase-3-sinatra-react-project). 

## Installation and Setup
First make sure you have npm installed: [https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/). Then fork and clone this project into your local environment. Navigate to the project folder in the command line, and run `npm install`, which will install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. From the command line, run the command `npm start`, which will serve the React app locally on port 3000. This should open automatically, but if it doesn’t, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
